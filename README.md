### Hi there 👋

 👩‍💻I’m a data scientist and Python developer, with 7+ year experience in financial industry and a strong statistical and quantitative background. I am very analytical and love data wrangling and drawing insights from data. I consider myself a lifetime learner and currently I want to dive deeper and know more about NLP and Neural Networks.
